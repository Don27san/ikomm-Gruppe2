class ConnectionHandler:
    """
    ConnectionHandler provides a high-level interface for managing TCP connections, supporting both client and server modes. 
    It abstracts away the complexities of socket handling, message delimitation, and concurrent connection management.
    Features:
    - Can operate as a TCP client or server.
    - Handles incoming and outgoing data streams, ensuring messages are properly delimited and queued.
    - Uses a background thread to listen for new connections (server mode) and to process incoming messages.
    - Maintains an internal queue of received messages, each associated with the sender's address and socket.
    - Supports configurable timeout for message retrieval from the queue.
    - Provides methods to send messages and to close the underlying socket. 
    Args:
        timeout (int, optional): Timeout in seconds for retrieving messages from the internal queue. If None, waits indefinitely.
    Raises:
        Exception: On malformed message headers or connection errors during message extraction.
    Usage:
        handler = ConnectionHandler(timeout=5)
        handler.start_server('127.0.0.1', 8080)
        # or
        handler.start_client('127.0.0.1', 8080)
        ...
        msg, addr, sock = handler.recv_msg()
        handler.send_msg(b"response")
        handler.close()
